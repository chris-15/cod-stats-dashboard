## Description

Welcome to CoD Dashboard, a Next.js application designed to serve as a comprehensive dashboard for Call of Duty Ranked enthusiasts. This platform provides users with the ability to record and monitor their ranked match statistics, offering a detailed and personalized insight into their gaming performance.

As an avid Call of Duty player, I always wanted to view my ranked match statistics but there was no dedicated sytem to do this. To address this, I leveraged my technical expertise to develop "CoD Dashboard", a Next.js application that fills this void. This platform not only enriches the gaming experience by providing a comprehensive tool for tracking and analyzing ranked match statistics, but also demonstrates the versatility of Next.js in building dynamic, user-focused applications.
